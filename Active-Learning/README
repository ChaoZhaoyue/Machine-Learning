This repository contains several functions for select the most informative unlabeled instances in active learning.


1. Expected Error Reduction ［1］
2. Density weight ［2］

Add toolbox to you path and compile before use.
addpath(‘./toolbox/libsvm-weights-3.20/matlab’)

Refer to the README in toolbox if you don’t know how to compile.
