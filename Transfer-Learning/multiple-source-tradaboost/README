The code for "Boosting for transfer learning with multiple sources" by Yi Yao and Gianfranco Doretto.

mstradaboost.m is for training
mstrpredict.m is for prediction

example:
[hyp,alpha] = mstradaboost(source,targettrnfeatures,targettrnlabels);
label = mstrpredict(targettestfeatures,hyp,alpha);

Please compile the toolbox and addpath to toolbox before using.
addpath('./toolbox/libsvm-weights-3.20/matlab');
